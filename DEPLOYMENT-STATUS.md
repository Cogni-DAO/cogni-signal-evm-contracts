# CogniDAO Deployment Status

## Current State: Proof of Concept Working ✅

The CogniDAO system is successfully deployed and functioning end-to-end with cogni-git-admin integration.

## What's Working

### Deployment (`make dao-setup`)
- Deploys complete governance stack: ERC20 token → DAO → CogniSignal
- Supports multiple governance providers (Aragon OSx, SimpleDAO)
- Generates environment variables for seamless integration
- Saves configuration to `.env.{TOKEN_SYMBOL}` file

### Integration with cogni-git-admin
- Environment variables from deployment work directly with cogni-git-admin
- Copy/paste the generated configuration to enable E2E testing
- Webhook processing via Alchemy functioning correctly
- GitHub operations triggered by on-chain governance signals

### Smart Contracts
- CogniSignal contract verified on Sepolia: `0x8F26cF7b9ca6790385E255E8aB63acc35e7b9FB1`
- Modular governance provider system operational
- Event emission and access control functioning as designed

## Current Limitations (POC Status)

### Single Wallet Execution
- System uses single wallet for all operations in E2E tests
- Not true multi-signature DAO governance
- Simplified permissions for development testing

### Production Readiness
- Requires proper multi-signature governance setup
- Needs comprehensive permission management
- Additional security auditing required
- Monitoring and alerting infrastructure not implemented

## Deployment Workflow

1. **Setup Environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.TOKEN.example .env
   # Edit .env with:
   # WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
   # EVM_RPC_URL=https://eth-sepolia...
   ```

2. **Deploy Stack**
   ```bash
   make dao-setup
   ```

3. **Copy Generated Variables**
   - Console output displays all required variables
   - Also saved to `.env.{TOKEN_SYMBOL}` file
   - Variables include:
     - `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` - Execution wallet
     - `EVM_RPC_URL` - Network RPC
     - `SIGNAL_CONTRACT` - CogniSignal address
     - `DAO_ADDRESS` - DAO contract
     - `CHAIN_ID` - Network ID
     - `ARAGON_ADMIN_PLUGIN_CONTRACT` - Admin plugin (if Aragon)

4. **Integrate with cogni-git-admin**
   - Paste variables into cogni-git-admin `.env` file
   - Run E2E tests to verify integration

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Governance Enhancement**
   - Implement proper multi-signature voting
   - Configure role-based permissions
   - Set up proposal and voting mechanisms

2. **Security Hardening**
   - Comprehensive smart contract audit
   - Rate limiting and spam protection
   - Emergency pause mechanisms

3. **Infrastructure**
   - Production-grade RPC endpoints
   - Monitoring and alerting systems
   - Backup and recovery procedures

4. **Documentation**
   - User guides for DAO members
   - Integration documentation for developers
   - Operational runbooks for maintainers

## Technical Stack

- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity with Foundry framework
- **Governance Providers**: Aragon OSx (production), SimpleDAO (development)
- **Network**: Sepolia testnet (mainnet deployment pending)
- **Integration**: cogni-git-admin for GitHub operations
- **Webhooks**: Alchemy for event monitoring
